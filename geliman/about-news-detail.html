                    The main controller of the Suidi Robot has a 5-inch capacitive touch display screen. This is the only product with a large touch screen for the programming block robots tested by Xiao Bian. With the addition of the touch screen, the Sui Di Robot Brings more intuitive and vivid demonstrations, which is also a new creation of the programming building block robot. Screen resolution Although there is no relevant parameter identification, but the naked eye can not see any grainy, the resolution should be quite high, the color is not biased, viewing educational video and text content is more comfortable; support multi-finger touch, such as can be realized in the assembly guide When the video can be opened with both hands to open the large screen operation, the sensitivity of the touch is quite high. The disadvantage is that the buttons on the corners of the corners are a little bit difficult to click (mainly the return buttons on the corner are more difficult). It can be solved by matching the stylus, or it is recommended to set a physical return button in the next robot version.
